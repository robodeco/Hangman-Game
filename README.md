# Hangman-Game
a simple hangman game using jquery and bootstrap.

terms are randomly pulled from 19 different words all relating to the hit game "Overwatch". the font used was "koverwatch" and "bignoodletoobolique", and the font palette aligns with the branding of the game itself.

the code itself is somewhat eclectic in order to demonstrate knowledge on certain coding techniques (such as case:break statements as opposed to if:else statements, or forEach as opposed to for loops).
